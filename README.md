# Supervised_machine_learning-challenge

Challenge: 
Build a two machine learning models that attempts to predict whether a loan will be approved or not. Compare the performance of the Logistic Regression Model and the Random Forest Classifier.

Background:
Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. This data will be used to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans.

Data: 
Located in the resources folder.

Task:
Load data.
Make a prediction as to which model will perform better. 
Create two models, a Logistic Regression Model and a Random Forest Classifier model.
Create training and testing data.
Fit and train models with approiprate data.
Calculate accuracy scores for both machine learning models.

Questions
Which model performed better?
How does that compare to my inital prediction?
