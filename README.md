# Supervised_machine_learning-challenge

## Challenge: 


Build a two machine learning models that attempts to predict whether a loan will be approved or not. Compare the performance of the Logistic Regression Model and the Random Forest Classifier.

## Background:


Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. This data will be used to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans.

## Data: 


Located in the resources folder.

## Task:


1. Load data.


2. Make a prediction as to which model will perform better. 


3. Create two models, a Logistic Regression Model and a Random Forest Classifier model.


4. Create training and testing data.


5. Fit and train models with approiprate data.


6. Calculate accuracy scores for both machine learning models.


## Questions


Which model performed better?


How does that compare to my inital prediction?
